## How to implement a labeling tool for image classification in a Jupyter notebook
I wrote a little piece about the implementation of a simple image labeling tool in jupyter with python.
The tool facilitates attaching class labels to a set of images without using a third paty service.
Anyone who knows how to run a jupyter server on their local machine can use it.
The post is available on [Medium](https://medium.com/dida-machine-learning/how-to-implement-an-image-labeling-tool-in-a-jupyter-notebook-4aa4099addba?source=friends_link&sk=3ee7eabd27f2bf29226fbd8e970cc1f6) and directly through [dida Machine Learning](https://dida.do/blog/how-to-implement-a-labeling-tool-for-image-classification-in-a-jupyter-notebook).
The belonging code can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/dida-do/public/tree/master/labelingtool).
