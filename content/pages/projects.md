#### Abstract
We estimate sectoral spillovers around the Great Moderation with the help of forecast error variance decomposition tables.
Obtaining such tables in high dimensions is challenging since they are functions of the estimated vector autoregressive coefficients and the residual covariance matrix.
In a simulation study, we compare various regularization methods for both and conduct a comprehensive analysis of their performance.
We show that standard estimators of large connectedness tables lead to biased results and high estimation uncertainty, which can both be mitigated by regularization.
To explore possible causes for the Great Moderation, we apply a cross-validated estimator on sectoral spillovers of industrial production in the US from 1972 to 2007.
We find that a handful of sectors considerably decreased their outgoing links, which hints at a complimentary explanation for the Great Moderation.

### The Granular Origins of Asset Prices
joint work with [Ruben Hipp](https://sites.google.com/view/rubenhipp/home)

#### Abstract
We investigate the implications of the granular hypothesis of Gabaix (2011) on asset prices.
In this framework, non-systematic shocks to US equities can have aggregate effects due to at least one of two reasons: (1) index weights are too concentrated for diversification arguments to apply, or (2) a spillover network propagates the shock to a large portion of investor wealth.
We estimate spillover networks of non-systematic variances for the 100 largest US equities.
The estimated networks describe how non-systematic variations are transmitted between assets, a channel that factor asset pricing models are unable to capture.
To construct network connectedness tables from daily variance observations, we use forecast error variance decompositions together with regularisation techniques for large-dimensional estimation.
We document the evolution of descriptive network statistics over time and collect first evidence on the networks' usefulness in forecasting variances and returns.

### Dynamic Density Forecasting with Hidden Markov Models
in development

#### Abstract
We demonstrate how dynamic probability densities can be obtained from the encompassing class of Hidden Markov Models.
Density forecasts under such models cover a wide range of shapes that evolve following the model dynamics.
We then benchmark the HMMsâ€™ capabilities to model data generating distributions in-sample and out-of-sample in a simulation study.
Finally, we apply the model to real-world financial and economic data.
