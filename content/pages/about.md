Summary:

## Felix Brunner
I do academic research in the field of applied econometrics and work on machine learning solutions to industry problems.
I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at [Nova SBE](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/) while working as a machine learning scientist at [dida](https://dida.do/).
My research interests lay at the intersection of econometrics and statistical learning, with a focus on network analysis and forecasting.
Over the course of my studies in economics, I developed a strong interest in machine learning, which led me to deepen my data science and programming skills.
I have written code in Python, Octave/Matlab, R, SQL, Visual Basic, and LaTeX. My language of choice is Python.
Libraries that I frequently use include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Hugging Face's transformers.

My website is solely my own work and does not reflect the views of any organization I am affiliated with.
