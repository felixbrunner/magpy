Summary:

## Felix Brunner

I am a **data scientist** with a proven track record in building custom **machine learning solutions** for classification, forecasting, and predictive analytics. Leveraging a strong analytical foundation from my PhD in quantitative economics, I specialize in delivering scalable models that transform complex data into actionable insights and automated workflows. My expertise spans time series analysis, image processing and text mining, with a focus on **Python** and advanced libraries such as PyTorch, scikit-learn, huggingface and langchain.

I apply best practices in **software engineering** to ensure clean, maintainable code and have successfully implemented end-to-end data projects, from conceptualization to deployment. I am also proficient in building **data transformation pipelines** with SQL and pandas, ensuring efficient data handling and integration in production environments.
