Summary:

## Felix Brunner

I am a data scientist working on machine learning solutions to industry problems with experience in the domains of time series, computer vision, and NLP.
While my primary skillset lays in the implementation of data transformation pipelines and predictive algorithms, I have also had exposure to the conceptualization and management of data projects.
My specialized experience working on data science problems reaches back five years, half of which in a professional context.
I have written code in Python, Octave/Matlab, R, SQL, Visual Basic, and LaTeX. My language of choice is Python.
Libraries that I frequently use include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and transformers.
Please find descriptions of some of the projects I have been involved with [here](projects).

Prior to working as a data scientist I did academic research in the field of applied econometrics as a PhD candidate at [Nova SBE](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/).
My research interests lay at the intersection of econometrics and statistical learning, with a focus on network analysis and forecasting.
Over the course of my studies, I developed a strong interest in machine learning, which led me to deepen my data science and programming skills.
Please find a collection of my research [here](research).
